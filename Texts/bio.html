<p>Hey there, I'm <strong>Elisangela Silva!</strong>
    I'm a web developer with a serious love for technology and innovation.
    I've got hands-on experience in various areas of software development,
    and right now, I'm diving into freelance projects using JavaScript,
    React, and Node.js. I'm also keeping some Java-based systems running smoothly.
    Here's a bit about what I've done:
    <p><strong> Support and Interface Development:</strong> Worked on a document processing and environmental policy platform using Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PostgreSQL.</p>
    <p><strong> Services Solutions:</strong> Helped develop and maintain a platform for home services using Ruby, Sinatra, Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, and GraphQL.</p>
    <p>These days, I'm expanding my skills by learning Python, Statistics, and Data Analysis. I'm always up for new challenges and eager to learn more! If you need any further tweaks or additions, just let me know!</p>
